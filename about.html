            <span>Our story</span>
            <p>In the past few years, I have been learning about blockchain and found that IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications and data developed by Juan Benet.</p>

            <p>IPFS is an amazing technology that changes the way humans and computers communicate in a decentralized world. However, accessing and using this technology is still difficult for an average user.</p>
                
            <p>Why is it difficult? To store a file on IPFS in a decentralized network like Filecoin, you need some computer knowledge to install software on your desktop, buy some cryptocurrency, and learn how to interact with the network.</p>
                
            <p>For that reason, I have developed a solution to store files on IPFS in a simpler way but still keep secure called Deupload. Deupload lets you store files on IPFS with file sharing, file request, and team collaboration features with a seamless user experience like the tools you've come to know and love.</p>
                
            <p>I hope Deupload can improve the file storage experience on a decentralized network and realize IPFS's vision of a future decentralized world.</p>

                <p>Our company uses Deupload, and i also use Box personally to store my documents, photos, videos, sensitive data etc. Deupload is amazing - so much more that just cloud storage. You can watch videos, share photos, scan documents, electronic sign and send documents, secure sensitive data and so much more.</p>

                <p>I love using Deupload for work and personally because it is very intuitive to use and easy to share files with anyone. Our company moved from dropbox over to box, due to security purposes which would be my concern but other than that it syncs very quickly and allows collaboration and file sharing alot easier for your team/company.</p>
